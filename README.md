Task Sheets
=============

The Iowa State University Extension and Outreach Geospatial Technology Program (ISUEOGTP) is administered through the Communities and Economic Development Extension office. The ISUEPGTP's mission is to provide training opportunities to those that are interested in learning geospatial technologies necessary for analyzing and visualizing data. Training opportunities include:
- Essentials of ArcGIS Tutorial Series, which provides hands-on introductory instruction to ArcGIS software, 
- task sheets that act as a supplement to the tutorial series by providing a quick how-to for a wide variety of GIS and mapping processes
- Introduction to QGIS hands-on workshop.

This repository is designed to host data and web mapping scripts described in the Task Sheets. To find a full list of task sheets, visit: [link]
