GIS Task Sheets
=============

The Iowa State University Extension and Outreach Geospatial Technology Program (ISUEOGTP) is administered through the Communities and Economic Development Extension office where its mission is to offer GIS training, task sheets, and other online educational resources to the public. The training programming includes the Essentials of ArcGIS Tutorial Series, which provides hands-on introductory instruction to ArcGIS software, and GIS task sheets that act as a supplement to the tutorial series by providing a quick how-to for a wide variety of GIS and mapping processes and our soon to be released Introduction to QGIS hands-on workshop.

This repository is designed to host data and web mapping scripts described in the Task Sheets. To find a full list of task sheets, visit: http://www.extension.iastate.edu/communities/gis/quicktasksheets
